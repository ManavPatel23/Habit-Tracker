# Google Sheets API Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automatic Google Sheets synchronization for your Habit Tracker app.

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" ‚Üí "New Project"
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "Habit Tracker")
4. Click "Create"

## Step 2: Enable Google Sheets API

1. In your project, go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
2. Search for "Google Sheets API"
3. Click on it and press "Enable"
4. Also enable "Google Drive API" (search and enable it)

## Step 3: Create a Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "Service Account"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "habit-tracker-service")
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Skip the optional steps and click "Done"

## Step 4: Generate Service Account Key

1. In the Credentials page, find your service account
2. Click on the service account email
3. Go to the "Keys" tab
4. Click "Add Key" ‚Üí "Create new key"
5. Choose "JSON" format
6. Click "Create"
7. The JSON file will download automatically

## Step 5: Configure the App

1. Rename the downloaded JSON file to `google_credentials.json`
2. Place it in the same folder as your `app.py` file
3. **Important**: Never commit this file to version control!

## Step 6: Share Your Google Sheet

1. Open your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jiMRMTmGRgk_i4vLLDdIUR8y4f95g1aVmvMgy0yzpMw/edit
2. Click "Share" (top right)
3. Add the service account email (found in your `google_credentials.json` file under `client_email`)
4. Give it "Editor" permissions
5. Click "Send"

## Step 7: Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 8: Test the Setup

1. Run your Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
2. In the sidebar, expand "‚òÅÔ∏è Google Sheets Sync"
3. You should see "üîë Google Sheets API credentials found - Auto-sync enabled!"
4. Try adding a habit activity - it should automatically save to Google Sheets

## Troubleshooting

### "Error initializing Google Sheets client"
- Make sure `google_credentials.json` is in the correct location
- Check that the JSON file is valid
- Verify the service account has the correct permissions

### "Error saving to Google Sheets"
- Make sure you shared the Google Sheet with the service account email
- Check that the service account has "Editor" permissions
- Verify the Google Sheets API is enabled in your project

### "Permission denied"
- Double-check that the service account email is added to the Google Sheet
- Make sure the service account has "Editor" access, not just "Viewer"

## Security Notes

- Never share your `google_credentials.json` file
- Add `google_credentials.json` to your `.gitignore` file
- The service account only has access to the specific Google Sheet you shared

## What This Enables

Once set up, your Habit Tracker will:
- ‚úÖ Automatically save data to Google Sheets when you add/remove activities
- ‚úÖ Automatically load data from Google Sheets when you refresh
- ‚úÖ No more manual copying and pasting of JSON data
- ‚úÖ Seamless synchronization across devices

Enjoy your fully automated habit tracking! üéâ
